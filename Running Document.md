## Methodology:

The [MBTA budget from 2025-2001](https://www.mbta.com/financials/mbta-budget) are available as pdfs, which are fed into tabula and output as csv. These are cleaned through pandas (eliminating whitespace) and converted to .xlsx. Then they are imported to google sheets and placed into according sheets.
